My own multithreaded (perchance) TCP/UDP (perchance) port scanner written in Python for enumeration.

# agenda
I dunno how I should start this project so I will quite literally do a bit of Googling and proompting to get a feel for things. I know my networking but I have 0 clue how port scanners actually work under the hood.

Multithreading will be used to separate scanning jobs so that multiple ports can be scanned in parallel and overall reduce the time taken to enumerate.
